# Italian Athletics Data Analysis

Developed by a fan of athletics and data, the goal of this project is to scrape historical Italian athletes' PB data as well as related information from the official [Italian Federation](https://www.fidal.it/graduatorie.php) rankings page.
The dataset contains over 900k entries of athletes' best performance on more than 20 track and field running events from 2005 to 2021.
Running events range from 60m to 100km on road covering indoors, outdoors, and road races.

This dataset is also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davideliu/italian-athletics-historical-best-performances).
